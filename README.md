# MusicPlayer
Full Stack music Player using js (frontend) and python(backend).
Till now,it has a home page that contains songs from db(From admins side), a playlist creation/view page and User authentication system.
Started with simple django models creation ,then connected models with foreinkey and created view logics for template rendering.
It uses django forms for playlist creation,and song addition in playlist.
For some places, i've used djangos template rendering for html page.
And for others i've used the Json context to collect API's from the backend and used them with js at frontend.
My Next commit in this repo  will be a Searching feature.
